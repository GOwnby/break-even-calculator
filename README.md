Here is a complete, step-by-step guide to run this script on a Windows computer, assuming you have never used Python before.

-----

### Step 1: Install Python 🐍

First, you need to install Python on your computer.

1.  Go to the official Python website: **[python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)**
2.  Click the big yellow button that says **"Download Python"** (it will show the latest version, like 3.12.4).
3.  The installer file (e.g., `python-3.12.4-amd64.exe`) will download to your `Downloads` folder.
4.  Open the downloaded file. A new window will pop up.
5.  **This is the most important step:** At the bottom of the installation window, check the box that says **"Add Python.exe to PATH"**. This allows you to run Python from any folder.
6.  Click **"Install Now"** and follow the on-screen instructions. It will only take a minute or two.

### Step 2: Save the Python Code 📝

Next, you need to save the code into a file that Python can read.

1.  Open the **Notepad** app on your PC. (You can find it by searching "Notepad" in the Start Menu).

2.  Copy the entire Python code block from our previous conversation.

    ```python
    def calculate_break_even_time():
        """
        Calculates the break-even time between two investments with different
        initial costs and annual maintenance fees.
        """
        print("--- Break-Even Point Calculator ---")
        print("Please enter the costs without commas or symbols.\n")

        try:
            # --- Get Natural Gas Plant Data ---
            initial_gas = float(input("Enter the initial cost of the Natural Gas plant: $"))
            maint_gas = float(input("Enter the ANNUAL maintenance fee for the Natural Gas plant: $"))

            # --- Get Solar System Data ---
            print("") # Add a space for readability
            initial_solar = float(input("Enter the initial cost of the Solar system: $"))
            maint_solar = float(input("Enter the ANNUAL maintenance fee for the Solar system: $"))

            # --- Perform Calculation ---

            # Check if maintenance costs are the same to avoid division by zero
            if maint_gas == maint_solar:
                if initial_gas == initial_solar:
                    print("\nBoth systems have the same initial and maintenance costs. The cost will always be identical.")
                elif initial_solar > initial_gas:
                    print("\nWith equal maintenance costs, the solar system will always be more expensive.")
                else:
                    print("\nWith equal maintenance costs, the solar system will always be cheaper.")
                return

            # The core break-even formula
            # t = (I_s - I_g) / (M_g - M_s)
            time = (initial_solar - initial_gas) / (maint_gas - maint_solar)

            print("\n--- Result ---")
            if time > 0:
                print(f"✅ The cost for the two systems will break even in {time:.2f} years.")
            else:
                # This occurs if the system with the lower maintenance fee also has a lower initial cost
                print("✅ The solar system is cheaper from the very beginning (t=0).")

        except ValueError:
            print("\n❌ Error: Invalid input. Please enter numbers only.")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"\n❌ An unexpected error occurred: {e}")

    # Run the calculator
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        calculate_break_even_time()
    ```

3.  Paste the code into Notepad.

4.  Go to **File \> Save As...**.

5.  In the "Save As" window, navigate to your **Desktop** so the file is easy to find.

6.  Click the "Save as type" dropdown and change it from "Text Documents (\*.txt)" to **"All Files"**.

7.  In the "File name" box, type **`break_even_calculator.py`**. The `.py` part is very important.

8.  Click **Save**. You will now see a new icon on your Desktop for this file.

### Step 3: Run the Program ▶️

Finally, you'll use the Command Prompt to run your new script.

1.  Open the **Command Prompt**. (Search "Command Prompt" or "cmd" in the Start Menu). A black window will appear.
2.  Your prompt probably starts in a folder like `C:\Users\YourName>`. You need to tell it to look at your Desktop where you saved the file. Type the following command exactly and press **Enter**:
    ```cmd
    cd Desktop
    ```
3.  Now the prompt should show `C:\Users\YourName\Desktop>`. You are in the right folder.
4.  To run the program, type the following command and press **Enter**:
    ```cmd
    python break_even_calculator.py
    ```
5.  The program will now start inside the black window\! It will ask you to enter the costs. Type in a number for each question and press **Enter**. It will then show you the final calculation. You can run it as many times as you like by repeating step 4.
